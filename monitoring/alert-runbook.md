# Alert Runbook

This document provides guidance for responding to alerts generated by the OptimaCore monitoring system.

## High Request Latency

**Alert**: `HighRequestLatency`
**Severity**: Error (1)

### Symptoms
- p95 request latency exceeds 1000ms
- Users may report slow response times
- API timeouts may occur

### Immediate Actions
1. Check the Application Insights "Performance" blade to identify slow endpoints
2. Review recent deployments for performance-related changes
3. Check database and cache metrics for related issues

### Resolution Steps
1. **For specific endpoints**:
   - Check for increased traffic to specific endpoints
   - Review query performance for database calls
   - Check for N+1 query problems

2. **System-wide issues**:
   - Check CPU/Memory usage on application servers
   - Review database connection pool metrics
   - Check for external service dependencies that might be slow

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Scale up/out application instances if needed
   - Add caching for expensive operations
   - Optimize database queries or add indexes

## Low Cache Hit Ratio

**Alert**: `LowCacheHitRatio`
**Severity**: Warning (2)

### Symptoms
- Cache hit ratio drops below 70%
- Increased database load
- Higher response times for cacheable content

### Immediate Actions
1. Check if cache invalidation is working correctly
2. Look for changes in data access patterns
3. Verify cache TTL settings

### Resolution Steps
1. **Investigate cache misses**:
   - Check for cache key collisions
   - Review cache invalidation logic
   - Look for hot keys or large objects being cached

2. **Optimize caching strategy**:
   - Adjust TTL settings
   - Consider multi-level caching
   - Implement cache warming for critical paths

## High RU Consumption

**Alert**: `HighRUConsumption`
**Severity**: Error (1)

### Symptoms
- Request Unit consumption exceeds 800 RUs
- Potential throttling of database operations
- Increased latency for database operations

### Immediate Actions
1. Identify high-RU operations in Application Insights
2. Check for sudden increases in request volume
3. Look for inefficient queries or full table scans

### Resolution Steps
1. **Query Optimization**:
   - Add missing indexes
   - Optimize query predicates
   - Use projection to limit returned fields

2. **Data Model Review**:
   - Consider denormalization
   - Review partitioning strategy
   - Evaluate data access patterns

## High Database Connections

**Alert**: `HighDatabaseConnections`
**Severity**: Error (1)

### Symptoms
- Active database connections exceed 40
- Connection pool exhaustion
- Increased error rates for database operations

### Immediate Actions
1. Check for connection leaks in application code
2. Look for long-running transactions
3. Monitor for connection pool saturation

### Resolution Steps
1. **Connection Management**:
   - Implement proper connection pooling
   - Add connection timeout settings
   - Ensure connections are properly closed in finally blocks

2. **Query Optimization**:
   - Identify and optimize long-running queries
   - Implement query timeouts
   - Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads

## High Error Rate

**Alert**: `HighErrorRate`
**Severity**: Error (1)

### Symptoms
- Error rate exceeds 1% of total requests
- Increased failed requests in logs
- Potential user impact

### Immediate Actions
1. Check Application Insights "Failures" blade
2. Look for patterns in error types
3. Check for recent deployments

### Resolution Steps
1. **Error Analysis**:
   - Categorize errors by type and endpoint
   - Check for dependency failures
   - Review exception details and stack traces

2. **Mitigation**:
   - Implement proper error handling and retries
   - Add circuit breakers for failing dependencies
   - Consider feature flags for graceful degradation

## Alert Response Workflow

1. **Acknowledge** the alert
2. **Assess** the impact and severity
3. **Contain** the issue if possible
4. **Diagnose** the root cause
5. **Resolve** the underlying issue
6. **Document** the incident and resolution

## Escalation Path

1. **First Responder**: On-call engineer (24/7)
2. **Secondary Escalation**: Team lead
3. **Tertiary Escalation**: Engineering manager

## Post-Mortem

For all severity 0-1 incidents, conduct a blameless post-mortem to:
- Document the timeline of events
- Identify root causes
- Document lessons learned
- Create action items to prevent recurrence
