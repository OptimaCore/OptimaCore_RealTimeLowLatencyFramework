## 🚀 Getting Started

### Docker Setup

For containerized deployment and local development, refer to the [Docker Setup Guide](docs/docker-setup.md).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Terraform (for infrastructure provisioning)
- PostgreSQL 14+ (or compatible database)
- Redis 6+ (for caching)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OptimaCore/OptimaCore_RealTimeLowLatencyFramework.git
   cd OptimaCore_RealTimeLowLatencyFramework
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   
   Run database tests specifically:
   ```bash
   npm test tests/database.test.js
   ```

3. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   # Create a new migration
   node services/database/migrations/migrate.js create migration_name
   
   # Apply pending migrations
   node services/database/migrations/migrate.js up
   
   # Rollback last migration
   node services/database/migrations/migrate.js down
   ```

4. Run linter:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

5. Run benchmarks:
   ```bash
   npm run bench
   ```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Key performance indicators (KPIs) are continuously monitored and optimized:

### Application Level
- **Latency**: < 10ms p99 for core operations
- **Throughput**: 100,000+ operations/second
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime

### Database Level
- **Query Performance**: < 5ms p95 for read queries
- **Connection Pool**: < 80% pool utilization under load
- **Replication Lag**: < 100ms for read replicas
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: > 95% for Redis cache
